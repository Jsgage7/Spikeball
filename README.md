## The Task/n
In 2008, Spikeball Roundnet Association was founded and played a major role in popularizing this sport. 
Historically, Spikeball has been a recreational sport, but with a recent rise in publicity and popularity, 
the Spikeball Roundnet Association set its sights on breaking into the professional sports realm. Roundnet 
is currently working towards this goal, specifically aiming to enter the NCAA and the Olympics and become a 
recognized professional sport. They have even struck some deals with major television stations like ESPN to 
bring greater attention and interest to the sport. To assist Roundnet with this initiative, we have decided 
to run a survey to pinpoint which aspects of Spikeball are exciting to both fans and non-fans. With survey 
data, we can measure which aspects of the game are interesting and create a viewability metric. This 
viewability metric will allow us to test future rule changes to see which ways the game can be shaped to be 
more interesting to viewers.

## The Data /n
In order to assess the different aspects of Spikeball that viewers find interesting, we gathered video clips
from Instagram and Youtube. We settled on short clips that average 10-20 seconds in length instead of full 
game videos to reduce survey length. Instagram mainly supplied highlight plays such as aces, body blocks, and
rallies that were a perfect length for our needs. After several survey iterations, our team distributed our 
survey through word of mouth, online forums, and after some emails were even able to get it posted to a 
Spikeball official Facebook page. Over the course of about a week, we were able to get around 250 responses.
Each participant watched a total of 4 videos, and the videos and order that each participant watched was 
randomized.
